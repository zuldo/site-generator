title: Is X "cheating"?
time: '18:26:26'

A question I've encountered various variations of at various points:

> Is X cheating?

Some possible values for X:

- Using a computer to [perform a task (usually one widely regarded as "creative")] instead of [performing the same task without using a computer].
- [Looking up the answer to a question online]/[asking someone for help with figuring it out] instead of figuring it out by yourself.

What game are you playing? What are the rules of that game? If you're breaking the rules, you're cheating.

An example (which is what made me write this post to begin with):

> Is digital drawing cheating?

What game are you playing? "Make the most out of limited tools"? "Create a beautiful drawing"? "Draw [some thing] as quickly as possible"? "Improve your ability to draw"? "Have fun"?

Answer that question, then figure out what the rules are, and you'll know whether you're cheating.
