Personal story about misusing empathy.

# Meta

Terminology note: [empathy](/glossary#empathy) is different from [compassion](/glossary#compassion).

I would like to put more effort into this, but it's late and I lack the Slack to do so right now. I will probably edit this post significantly tomorrow.

Recently I noticed a certain counterproductive pattern my mind would follow.

A few years ago, I started taking advice like "imagine yourself in their shoes" seriously. I'd slowly build up a habit of seriously trying to empathize with people in certain situations. My memory is vague regarding what situations, but my best guess is situations like [when I feel like I [can't understand]/[am angry or annoyed at] someone]. I took this quite seriously. My memory is also vague regarding why I did this.

<p id="habit">
Over time this would grow into a mostly unconscious habit, and activate in more situations, and become more automatic/atomic. Which I completely missed until a few days ago.

This made me sometimes feel bad upon hearing about other people's problems. As in negative reinforcement for *learning* about other's problems. (I don't think this ever got *significantly* bad. But probably mostly because of other counterproductive patterns accidentally being productive here.)

I suspect it was also involved in some of the patterns that made a friend of mine say this to me ~2 months ago:

> I think youâ€™re worried too much about trying to relate to everyone around you

Also, I suspect there are certain other mistakes in using empathy that got magnified by this (Mistakes which I might write about some other time.).

So far, I've tried to fix this by learning how to *avoid* using empathy, so that I'll be able to [use it only when I want to]. I don't really know how I'm doing this yet, but I have weak evidence that simply wanting it to happen has significant effects.
