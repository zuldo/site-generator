---summary---

Instrumental values change (preferably to better fulfill terminal values). I took long to actually understand this. Oops.

---content---

For a long time I made the [bucket error](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bucket-errors) of confusing *instrumental* values for *terminal* values. Thinking any change in instrumental values was value drift, feeling slightly queasy when reflecting on how for instance my taste in music have changed over time.

> I decided that it would be useful to develop a taste for wet weather, and pulled out my notebook du jour to note that if I saw a way to do that, I should. 

\- [Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/), chapter 1.

When I first read the above I was confused by how the protagonist *wanted* to change her own values. I understand now that weather preferences are not terminal.

So, your instrumental values can change. And you tautologically want them to change in ways that fulfill your terminal values. Some guesses as to how to make this happen (more effectively) (I will update this list [ifwhen](/glossary#ifwhen) I get more ideas.):

- Applying [Internal Double Crux](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mQmx4kQQtHeBip9ZC/internal-double-crux) (or other equivalently effectful methods for increasing internal coherence) to conflicting [instrumental values]/[subagents].

Some common examples of instrumental values changing:

- Music taste.
- Literal taste.
	- For instance, (going by imagination) eating most animal products now is less enjoyable for me than it was before I became a vegan.
