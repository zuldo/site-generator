While you're interacting with something that requires attention, your speed of thought is upper-bound by the input and output speed of that interaction. Since any thoughts that can't be part of the interaction (directly or indirectly) will not get attention.

(Edit 2021-12-20: the type of thoughts you can have is also limited to be overall relevant to the interaction. (There's both speed and topic, I might write more about that later.))

While you're not interacting with something that requires attention, your speed of thought is upper-bound by your raw speed of computation, modified by context.

Not "doing anything in particular" makes thinking easier. Until you find something you want to keep for future consideration. Then you [write it down, freeing up that mental space](/posts/memory-feedback-loops) again.

Actionable advice: to think unconstrained by IO speed, do nothing, then [pause your feedback loops](http://bewelltuned.com/pause_your_feedback_loops). (Since feedback loops also take up attention (Hypothesis: activites without feedback loop aren't thought-constraining.).)

Edit 2022-01-20: see also [Solutide before meditation](https://spacelutt.com/solitudefirst). It's consistent with my past brief ventures into meditation.
