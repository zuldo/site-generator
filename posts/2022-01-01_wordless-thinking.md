I can sometimes choose to mostly not have an internal monologue. This speeds up my thoughts.

At some point in the distant past I noticed that I can use my [internal monologue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_monologue) drastically less than I do by default. And that this speeds up my thoughts a lot - that is, my internal monologue slows down my thinking.

The way the relevant mental motion feels like is something like, "Assume that I already know what I'm going to think before the monologue finishes expressing it. Then don't let the monologue start expressing it to begin with.". Not as in surpressing my thoughts, but as in not thinking in words what I have already thoughts in [magic thought format]. I already *know* what the relevant thoughts are, I don't need to express them in words to use them.

> - It's very important to focus on what feels like very quick, atomic transitions. Do not wait until you have a full word or sentence formed in your mind!

> - Aim for sub-second timescales. In fact, you can easily have a chain of 5 or more conscious thoughts in one second. If you think you can't, you're just missing skill in noticing it.
