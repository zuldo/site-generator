<p>This website is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and generated with <a href="https://bolt80.com/piecrust/">PieCrust</a>.</p>
<p>My blog used to be located <a href="https://write.as/zuldo/">here</a>.</p>
<p>For practical info about how I make this website work, see <a href="/about-website.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p><s>If you want to make a comment, send me an email saying what you want to comment, on which page, what username (optionally as a link), and I might add it.</s> This will apply when I’ve made a working comment system.</p>
<p>Note that the GitHub commit history was reset on 2022-01-08 because I deleted and recreated the GitHub repo as a hack solution to a problem caused by my past lack of planning.</p>
<p>I may update any part of this website (except comments, <a href="/glossary#ifwhen">ifwhen</a> I get those to work) at any time without indicating it. If you want to see old versions you can look at the Git history.</p>
