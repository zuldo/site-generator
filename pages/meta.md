# Website

This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and generated with [PieCrust](https://bolt80.com/piecrust/).

My blog used to be located [here](https://write.as/zuldo/).

For practical info about how I make this website work, see [this page](/about-website.html).

<s>If you want to make a comment, send me an email saying what you want to comment, on which page, what username (optionally as a link), and I might add it.</s> This will apply when I've made a working comment system.

Note that the GitHub commit history was reset on 2022-01-08 because I deleted and recreated the GitHub repo as a hack solution to a problem caused by my past lack of planning.

I may update any part of this website (except comments, [ifwhen](/glossary#ifwhen) I get those to work) at any time without indicating it. If you want to see old versions you can look at the Git history.
